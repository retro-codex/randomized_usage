###Used to combine usernames and passwords to prep for coding. Output syntax is 'username:password'

#open read files and target write file
usernamefile = open("usernames.txt", "r")
passwd = open("passwords.txt", "r")
target = open("un_passwd_sandwich.txt", "w")
#for loop nested for loop. 
for i in usernamefile:
    for p in passwd:
        #write to target file usernamefile entry + special character + passwd file entry, and remove newline characters at end of each entry
        target.write(i.replace("\n","")+":"+p.replace("\n",""))
        #write to target, but now add a new line after each grouping
        target.write("\n")
    #tells the passwd file to start at position 0 (top of the file) [possibly for every entry in usernamefile]
    passwd.seek(0)

target.close()
